### Hola 👋
---

I'm Nick—a senior product manager and designer at USCIS working on Global to support refugee case processing. I previously worked on the asylum team to increase efficiency in how the agency receives, vets, and adjudicates asylum applications. I love drawing in my spare time, being outdoors, and trying to find time to work through my backlog of movies, books, and video games. 

### How I work 💪
---
- User Research: user interviews, usability tests, journey maps, SQL
- UI Design: prototyping (Sketch, Figma), illustration (Medibang)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript
- Product Management: user stories (JIRA, Trello), Excel

### More about me 🧐
---
- I believe that working in small, balanced teams can help achieve meaningful results quickly.
- Cruft and clutter make me cringe.
- I love coffee and learning from others.
- I'm currently working on my digital illustration skills and teaching myself React.
- One thing I've been putting is off starting my own web comic.
