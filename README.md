### Hola 👋
---

I'm Nick—a senior product manager and designer at USCIS working on Global to support refugee case processing. Previously worked on the asylum team to help increase efficiency in how the agency receives, vets, and adjudicates asylum applications. I love drawing in my spare time, being outdoors, and trying to find time to work through my backlog of video games and manga. 

### More about me 🧐
---
- 🤙 I believe that working in small, balanced teams can help achieve meaningful results quickly.
- 🙀 Cruft and clutter make me cringe.
- ☕️ I love cofee and learning from others.
- 🎨 I'm currently working on my digital illustration skills and teaching myself React.
- 💥 One thing I've been putting is off starting my own web comic.
